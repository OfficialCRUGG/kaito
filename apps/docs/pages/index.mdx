### Features

- ‚úç built in zod schema + body validation support
- ‚ö° ultra quick. faster than express with just one dependency
- üí™ robust
- üí® extremely easy to use, functional pattern

### What is Kaito not?

Kaito is not:

- Stable
- Battle tested

## Principles

- No middleware! I've always disliked the middleware pattern, for two reasons. The first is that it's difficult to make guarantees about where and the order that middleware run, and secondly it's hard to provide robust type information for middleware
- JSON only. This makes it √ºber easy to build an API without having to think about what's happening behind the scenes
- e2e types. Kaito supports exporting the entire API as a TypeScript interfaces, including all response types. This allows for easy building of a client
