# Routers

Routers hold all of our routes and their metadata. Cruically, they also provide a `.find()` method that Kaito's server uses to locate a route on each request.

## Creating a Router

Routers can be created as many times as you want in your app with the `createRouter` function exported by `@kaito-http/core`. Example below:

<Callout emoji="âš ">The example below is not the recommend approach, please continue reading afterwards</Callout>{' '}

```ts
import {Router} from '@kaito-http/core';

const router = Router.create();
```

This will be an instance of `Router`, with a few TypeScript generics to store our route response types.

However, the recommended approach is to define, externally, a custom `createRouter` function that will include the type information from our `getContext` function.
This is so that we do not have to copy and paste the type information into our `createRouter` function each time we would like to
create another router.

We can do this by exporting another function in our `context.ts` file called `createRouter` or `router` (or something like that).

```ts {7,9-11}
import {Router, createGetContext, InferContext} from '@kaito-http/core';

export const getContext = createGetContext(async (req, res) => {
	// ...
});

export type AppContext = InferContext<typeof getContext>;

export function router() {
	return Router.create<AppContext>();
}
```

And then you are safe to use the `router` function around your app, which will guarantee context type safety.

## Router Merging

Kaito supports Router Merging, which is bringing one router's route into another, with a prefix. This is incredibly useful for larger apps, for example when you have multiple versions of an API.

```ts {4}
import {v1} from './routers/v1';
import {v2} from './routers/v1';

export const api = createRouter().merge('/v1', v1).merge('/v2', v2);
```

You can expect all type information to be carried over as well as the route names and their prefixes.
