# Routes

Routes are the basic building blocks of Kaito. They represent a single HTTP route with an optional input schema and async execution logic.

## Creating a Route

Creating a route requires us to have a router already established. If you don't, please checkout the <Link href="/getting-started#concepts">getting started</Link> guide.

Here's an extremely basic example of a ping/pong route.

```ts
const router = createRouter().add({
	method: 'GET',
	path: '/ping',
	async run() {
		return 'PONG';
	},
});
```

## Constraints

- Route `run` functions must be async.
- Route return types **must** be JSON serializable.

## Input

Routes can also take a query and body schema provided by Zod. Internally, Kaito wil validate all request bodies and query params so you can be absolutely certain you are processing the right data.

```ts
import {z} from 'zod';

const router = createRouter().add({
	method: 'POST',
	path: '/echo',
	query: {
		content: z.string(),
	},
	body: z.number(),
	async run({body, query}) {
		// Echo it back
		return {body, query};
	},
});
```

Zod schemas can be of any shape or size, including objects, booleans, numbers and literals. For more reference, please read the <Link href="https://github.com/colinhacks/zod#basic-usage">Zod Documentation</Link>.
