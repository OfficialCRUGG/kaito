# Context

In Kaito, context is information shared to every single route. It's provided at the root of your application and is generated on every single request.

For example, if you want to provide the `req` and `res` objects to each route, you should add it to your context.

Below is an example of things that you could include, but it's really up to you and what you would find useful to include in your app.

```ts
export const getContext = createGetContext(async (req, res) => {
	return {
		req,
		res,
		time: new Date(),

		// Example implementing some database resources
		users: {
			async search(query: string) {
				//
			},

			async byId(id: string) {
				//
			},
		},

		sessions: {
			async create(userId: string) {
				//
			},

			async resolve() {
				return req.headers.authorization;
			},
		},
	};
});
```

You can then use this context, when setup correctly with a router, inside every single route. E.g.

```ts
import {z} from 'zod';

export const users = createRouter().get('/users', {
	input: z.string(),
	async run({ctx, input}) {
		return ctx.users.search(input);
	},
});
```
