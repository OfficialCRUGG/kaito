# Server

The `createServer` function is a very minimal part of Kaito, it is almost not worth writing docs for it as it simply wraps `http.createServer`.

As of version `2.3.0`, kaito implemented `find-my-way` which massively improves performance, so we expose the internal fmw instance if you would like to access it for whatever reason.

To use it, simply replace your `createServer` import and call with `createFMWServer`.

Below is an example of using `find-my-way` to pretty print a list of all available routes.

```ts
import {createFMWServer} from '@kaito-http/core';

const {server, fmw} = createFMWServer({
	getContext,
	router,
	// ...
});

server.listen(8080, () => {
	console.log(fmw.prettyPrint());
});
```
